# Area of a Circle
The formula to calculate the area of a circumference is defined as A = ? . R2. Considering to this problem that ? = 3.14159:
 
Calculate the area using the formula given in the problem description.
 
**Input**

The input contains a value of floating point (double precision), that is the variable R.
 
**Output**

Present the message "A=" followed by the value of the variable, as in the example bellow, with four places after the decimal point. Use all double precision variables. Like all the problems, don't forget to print the end of line after the result, otherwise you will receive "Presentation Error".

# Simple Sum
Read two integer values, in this case, the variables A and B. After this, calculate the sum between them and assign it to the variable SOMA. Write the value of this variable.

**Input**

The input file contains 2 integer numbers.

**Output**

Print the message "SOMA" with all the capital letters, with a blank space before and after the equal signal followed by the corresponding value to the sum of A and B. Like all the problems, don't forget to print the end of line, otherwise you will receive "Presentation Error"

# T-Shirts
Professor Rolien and their Computer Science students are making a polo shirt that need to be both beautiful and inexpensive. After some meetings, it was agreed with the students that would be made ​​only black shirts but the students could choose between the color details (white or red). Therefore, Rolien needs your help to arrange the lists for all classes for those that want to buy the shirt, relating these shirts by color details, size (P: small), M or (G:large) and lastly by name.

**Input**

The input contains several test cases. Each test case begins with a integer and positive N (1 ≤ N ≤ 60), that indicates the amount of shirts that will be made for that class. The next N*2 lines contains information of each shirt (will be two lines of information for each shirt). The first line will contain the student's name and the second line will contain the color of the shirt details ("branco" -white or "vermelho" -red) followed by a space and the size of the shirt "P" "M" or "G". The input ends when the value of N equals zero (0) and this number should not be processed.

**Output**

For each test case print the information sorted by color details in ascending order, followed by size in descending order and at last, by name in ascending order, as shown below.

Note: should be printed a blank line between two test cases.


# Huaauhahhuahau
In chats, it is very common among young people and adolescents use strings of letters, which often seem random to represent laughter. Some common examples are:

huaauhahhuahau
hehehehe
ahahahaha
jaisjjkasjksjjskjakijs
huehuehue

Claudia is a young programmer who was intrigued by the sound of "digital laughter." Some of them she can not even pronounce! But she realized that some of them seem better convey the feeling of laughter than others. The first thing she noticed is that the consonants do not interfere in how digital laughter influence the feeling of transmission. The second thing she noticed is that the funniest digital laughter are those in which the sequences of vowels are the same when read in the natural order (from left to right) or in reverse order (from right to left), ignoring consonants. For example, "hahaha" and "huaauhahhuahau" are among the funniest laughs while "riajkjdhhihhjak" and "huehuehue" are not among the funniest.

Claudia is very busy with the statistical analysis of digital laughter and asked for his help to write a program that determines, to a digital laugh, if she is the funniest or not.

**Input**

The input comprises a line containing a sequence of up to 50 characters, formed only by small letters without accent. Vowels are the letters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. The sequence contains at least one vowel.

**Output**

Your program should produce a line containing a character, "S" if the laughter is of the funniest, or "N" otherwise.


# Grandpa's Balance
Grandpa John runs a newspaper stand; he has many customers and receives a lot of money every day, but he also makes many payments to maintain his stock of newspapers and magazines. Every day he goes to the bank to make a deposit or withdrawal of money. On some days, the balance in his bank account is negative, but Grandpa John has an agreement with the bank that guarantees that he will only be charged if the balance is less than a pre-established amount.

Given the daily activity in Grandpa John's bank account, you must write a program that calculates the lowest balance in the account, in the given period.

**Input**

The first line of the input contains two integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 30) and S (−103 ≤ S ≤ 103) that indicate respectively the number of days in the period of interest and the account balance at the beginning of the period. Each of the following N lines contains an integer indicating the movement of a day (−103 ≤ each movement ≤ 103), (positive value in the case of deposit, negative value in the case of withdrawal). The movement is given for a period of N consecutive days: the first of the N lines corresponds to the first day of the period of interest, the second line corresponds to the second day, and so on.

**Output**

Your program should print a single line, containing a single integer, the lowest value of the account balance in the given period.
